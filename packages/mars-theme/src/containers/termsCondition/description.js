            permit copyright infringing activities on the Curriki Site.

            may charge an annual membership fee to You or to the commercial

            credit, debit or charge card number, if applicable), then You agree
            to immediately notify Curriki. You may be liable for the losses

            concerned with activities such as linking to an internal or
            subsidiary page of the Curriki Site that is located one or several
            levels down from the home page of the Curriki Site (“Deep Linking”)
            and incorporating any part of the Curriki Site, including without
            limitation any Contribution, as part of your own web page
            (“Framing”). In this regard, without limiting the provisions
            contained herein, you must make a specific request for, and secure
            permission from, Curriki prior to Deep Linking to, or Framing, any
            part of the Curriki Site, including without limitation any
            Contribution, or engaging in similar activities. Deep Linking to or
            Framing any part of the Curriki Site may only be carried out if you
            have obtained express prior written permission from Curriki or
            executed a separate contract with Curriki.
