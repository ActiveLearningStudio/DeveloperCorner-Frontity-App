            <h5>Generally</h5>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Curriki in the
            most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Curriki agree that
            every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be
            resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a
            lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
            judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court,
            and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can
            award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This
            agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of
            or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract,
            tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory,
            and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the
            termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY
            ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CURRIKI ARE EACH WAIVING THE
            RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

          </div>
          <p>
            Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will
            be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either
            party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b)
            pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state,
            or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive
            relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to
            address an intellectual property infringement claim.

          <p>
            Any arbitration between you and Curriki will be settled under the
            Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute
            Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
            Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American
            Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and
            will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
            available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
            1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Curriki.

            <h5>Notice; process</h5>
          </div>
          <p>
            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
            notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or
            by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party
            has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail
            (“Notice”). Curriki’s address for Notice is: Curriki 20660 Stevens
            Creek Boulevard #332 Cupertino, CA 95014. The Notice must: (a)
            describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set
            forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make
            good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties
            do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice
            is received, you or Curriki may commence an arbitration proceeding.
            During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
            you or Curriki must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after
            the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the
            dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor,
            Curriki will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount
            awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement
            amount offered by Curriki in settlement of the dispute prior to the
            arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
          </p>
          <div className="sub-heading-content">

            <h5>Fees</h5>
          </div>
          <p>
            If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Curriki
            will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your
            claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any
            fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will
            take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County,
            California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose
            whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis
            of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a
            non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person
            hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of
            your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the
            substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
            frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
            standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then
            the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that
            case, you agree to reimburse Curriki for all monies previously
            disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the
            AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
            conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision
            sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
            which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may
            make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and
            reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
            and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
            arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

            Further, unless both you and Curriki agree otherwise, the arbitrator
            may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not

            proceeding.

            provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you
